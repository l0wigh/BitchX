BitchX1.2.1
=========
BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka
panasync@efnet. BitchX was originally based on ircII 2.8, but is currently
based on the ircii-EPIC4 releases by Jeremy Nelson.

BitchX was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy
for the popular UNIX IRC client ircII. Around Christmas of 1994 the
script was patched directly into the client by panasync.
